Scripts and Programs for my Homematic Home Automation.

I am using Homematic products to automate some processes for my House and Garden. This repo contains scripts and other code that is worth sharing.

- Hiwi Voice Control: This project uses PicoVoice on a Raspberry Pi for wake-word and intent recognition. It used AWS Polly for dynamic voice output. Towards the CCU, I use the XML-API addon. Written in Python.
- Display Unit: The script here is used to feed the simple Display with status information about open windows and I use this to enable the intrusion detection alarm system.
