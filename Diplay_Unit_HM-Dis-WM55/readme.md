#Scripts for Display Unit HM-Dis-WM55
The script here is used to feed the simple Display with status information about open windows and I use this to enable the intrusion detection alarm system.
The buttons of the Display unit are connected with changes to a global variable in which I store the "page" in which the Display is active. Based on that variable, the display shows different data.
